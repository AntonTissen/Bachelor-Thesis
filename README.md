Abstract:This bachelor's thesis explores how political actors and the sentiment they disseminate on Twitter shape the public's perception of the Ukraine war. By employing sentiment analysis using the VADER tool, network analysis, and statistical tests, the study examined the influence of key actors such as official political channels, news agencies, and prominent figures like Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin. The majority of the analyzed corpus exhibited a predominantly negative sentiment (-80.145%). A detailed examination of the mentions in tweets about Zelensky and the official Kremlin account revealed significant disparities in the sentiment of the published content. The calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.00376 and the p-value of 0.45188 indicate that there is no statistically significant linear relationship between the sentiment of the tweets and user interaction. This suggests that other factors, such as the specific content of the tweets or external events, may have a more profound impact on user reactions. Overall, this study provides an initial insight into the discourse structure during the first week of the war, although the dataset is limited and thus only captures a fragment of the broader discussion.
